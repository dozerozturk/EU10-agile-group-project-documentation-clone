as a developer, I create some code in my local machine
Then I think it is ready
I push it to GitHub
When I push it, Jenkins (CI tool) picks up the latest code and builds it
After a successful builds, we got artifact and artifactId
Then developer now can use the artifact number and deploy the build on the dev server

develop -> push -> build -> deploy
