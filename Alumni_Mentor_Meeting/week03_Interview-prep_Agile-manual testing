Thank you for your attendance today. Next week we will make our first interview practice session on Agile and Manuel Testing.
I will ask questions about it. I am planning to share a sample questions document.
Please review that document and get ready for interview practice session to get the best out of the session.
And also get ready for the questions like

- How do you implement Agile in you current projects
- How is your team structure
- How do you calculate team capacity?
- How do you give points for user story?
